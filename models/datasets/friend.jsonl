    { "role": "assistant", "content": " Yeah , I think that is the best option . Do you serve food on the train ? Twelve hours is such a long time ! " },
    { "role": "user", "content": " Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers . " },

    { "role": "user", "content": " I really hope it doesn't get cold . " },

If two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies .

By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating . "
    },

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": " Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled . "

    { "role": "assistant", "content": " He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen . " },
    { "role": "user", "content": " Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated ! " },
    { "role": "assistant", "content": " C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . " },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": " That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . "

    { "role": "user", "content": " We need to find a good realtor . " },
    { "role": "assistant", "content": " Not necessarily . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive . " },
    { "role": "user", "content": " What do you mean ? " },
    { "role": "assistant", "content": " Realtors always get a commission.If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him . " },
    { "role": "user", "content": " But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles . " },
    { "role": "assistant", "content": " Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them . " },
    { "role": "user", "content": " I still think we should have a realtor.We ' re new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house.And also , the realtor will inspect the house.He can tell us if the house has " },

    { "role": "user", "content": " So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ? " },
    { "role": "assistant", "content": " It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper.Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads.Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them . " },
    { "role": "user", "content": " And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ? " },
    { "role": "assistant", "content": " Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves . " },
    { "role": "user", "content": " Why ? " },
    { "role": "assistant", "content": " Because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher.He will have to pay a commission to the realtor . " },
    { "role": "user", "content": " Hmm . It all sounds very complicated . " },
    { "role": "assistant", "content": " It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time.That ' s why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome . " },
    { "role": "user", "content": " I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like . " },
    { "role": "assistant", "content": " Alright . I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drug store . " },
